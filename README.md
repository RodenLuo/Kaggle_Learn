Notes from Kaggle Learn

I plan to give PyTorch a try this time. 

## PyTorch

Installation:

  1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download), choose commandline version.
  2. Install PyTorch via Anaconda, [link](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
  
Learn it: 
  1. Official [Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/). Go from [60-min blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html).
  2. Course at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/practical-deep-learning-with-pytorch/).
  3. Course at [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/deep-learning-with-python-and-pytorch).
